    <p>Hi! My name is Atticus Ervin, and I am a Sophomore in High School. Some 
      of my hobbies are cooking, playing chess and playing video games. I started
      to play chess because I felt like doing activity after school, but also
      it can improve your problem solving in the real world. This is a website 
      that shows you the most important aspects to create a website.</p>
      <p>Some of my favortie video games are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apex Legends</li>
        <li>Fortnite</li>
        <li>Call Of Duty</li>
      </ul>
