     <p>The final thing to creating simple website is content. The content
       allows for the author to express their ideas and information.
       Also, all content that you write in html goes inside the body 
       (&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;) tag.</p><img alt="image of my nav" src="Images/Screenshot 2023-12-30 3.15.44 PM.png">

            &lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Atticus Ervin, and I am a Sophomore in High School. Some 
            of my hobbies are cooking, playing chess and playing video games. I started
            to play chess because I felt like doing activity after school, but also
            it can improve your problem solving in the real world. This is a website 
            that shows you the most important aspects to create a basic website.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p>Some of my favortie video games are:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li>Apex Legends&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li>Fortnite&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li>Call Of Duty&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

     <p>In this piece of html we have the paragraph tag or p which tells the
        computer that this part is a paragraph where the author writes 
        information. Lastly, we have an unordered list which like the previous 
        page gives us a list of items without an order.</p>
